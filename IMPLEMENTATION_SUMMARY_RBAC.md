# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) in the Candescent Win Room Dashboard, differentiating between Executive Sponsors (Exec Sponsor) and Delivery Success Managers (DSM) users.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates âœ…

**New User Role:**
- Added `exec_sponsor` to the `user_role` enum type

**New Risk Indicator Fields on `accounts` table:**
- `dsm_risk_assessment` (BOOLEAN) - DSM has flagged this account as at risk
- `auto_renew` (BOOLEAN) - Account has auto-renewal enabled
- `pricing_outlier` (BOOLEAN) - Account pricing is flagged as an outlier

**New Indexes:**
- Added indexes for all new risk indicator fields for optimal query performance
- Added index for `subscription_end` field

**Migration File Created:**
- `supabase/migrations/add_exec_sponsor_role_and_risk_fields.sql`

### 2. API Enhancements âœ…

**New Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/users/me` - Returns current authenticated user with role information

**Enhanced `/api/accounts` Endpoint:**
- **Role-Based Filtering:** DSM users automatically see only their accounts (where `dsm_id` = user ID)
- **New Filter Options:**
  - `all` - All accounts
  - `at_risk` - Accounts meeting at-risk criteria
  - `top_50_risk` - Top 50 riskiest accounts
  - `contract_expiring` - Contracts expiring within 90 days
- **At-Risk Definition:** Accounts with ARR > $400k, contract ending within 90 days, and at least one risk factor

### 3. Frontend Components âœ…

**New Component:**
- `components/dashboard/account-search.tsx` - Comprehensive account search replacing the old at-risk search

**Features:**
- Advanced filtering system (View, DSM, Exec Sponsor)
- Risk indicator columns displayed in table
- Export to CSV functionality
- Real-time search
- Active filter badges
- Sortable columns

### 4. Role-Based Navigation âœ…

**Updated `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:**
- Dynamic navigation based on user role
- **DSM:** Only sees "My Accounts"
- **Exec Sponsor:** Sees "Executive Summary" and "Account Search"
- **Admin:** Sees all navigation options
- **Viewer:** Sees "Executive Summary" only

### 5. New Routes âœ…

**Created Pages:**
1. `/dashboard/accounts` - Account Search (Exec Sponsor & Admin only)
2. `/dashboard/my-accounts` - My Accounts (DSM only)
3. `/dashboard/executive-summary` - Updated with role-based access

**Updated Main Dashboard:**
- `/dashboard` now automatically redirects based on user role:
  - DSM â†’ `/dashboard/my-accounts`
  - Exec Sponsor â†’ `/dashboard/executive-summary`
  - Admin/Viewer â†’ `/dashboard/executive-summary`

### 6. Security Implementation âœ…

**Server-Side Protection:**
- All routes check user role at the server level
- API filters accounts by role before returning data
- Unauthorized access attempts automatically redirect to appropriate pages

### 7. Updated Type Definitions âœ…

**`lib/types/database.ts`:**
- Added `exec_sponsor` to `UserRole` type
- Added risk indicator fields to `Account` interface

## Account Search Features

### Filter Options Available:
1. **View Filter:**
   - All Accounts
   - At Risk Accounts
   - Top 50 At Risk
   - Contract Expiring Soon

2. **DSM Filter:** Select specific DSM (hidden for DSM users)
3. **Exec Sponsor Filter:** Select specific Executive Sponsor
4. **Search Box:** Full-text search across multiple fields

### Table Columns Displayed:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Account Name | Primary account identifier |
| Location | Account location |
| DSM | Assigned Delivery Success Manager |
| Exec Sponsor | Assigned Executive Sponsor |
| ARR | Annual Recurring Revenue (sortable) |
| Health Score | Account health score (sortable) |
| Path to Green | Has path to green status |
| Contract End | Subscription end date (sortable) |
| Health<600 | Risk indicator badge |
| DSM Risk | Risk indicator badge |
| Auto Renew | Status indicator |
| Price Outlier | Risk indicator badge |

## At-Risk Definition

An account is flagged as "at risk" when **ALL** of the following are true:

1. âœ… **ARR > $400,000**
2. âœ… **Contract expiring within 90 days**
3. âœ… **At least one risk factor:**
   - Health score < 600
   - DSM risk assessment = true
   - Path to green = false
   - Auto renew = false
   - Pricing outlier = true

## Files Created/Modified

- `supabase/migrations/add_exec_sponsor_role_and_risk_fields.sql`
- `app/api/users/me/route.ts`
- `app/dashboard/accounts/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/my-accounts/page.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/account-search.tsx`
- `ROLE_BASED_ACCESS_CONTROL.md` (comprehensive documentation)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_RBAC.md` (this file)

### Modified:
- `supabase/schema.sql` - Added new role and fields
- `lib/types/database.ts` - Updated type definitions
- `app/api/accounts/route.ts` - Added role-based filtering
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Added role-based navigation

- `app/dashboard/executive-summary/page.tsx` - Added access control

## Next Steps - Action Required

### 1. Apply Database Migration

You need to apply the migration to add the new database fields and role:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI (recommended)
cd /Users/danielban/candescent
supabase db push

# Or connect to your database and run:
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d your-database -f supabase/migrations/add_exec_sponsor_role_and_risk_fields.sql
```

### 2. Update User Roles

Update existing users to have the correct roles:

```sql
-- Example: Update users to exec_sponsor role
UPDATE users SET role = 'exec_sponsor' 
WHERE id IN ('user-id-1', 'user-id-2');

-- Example: Update users to dsm role
UPDATE users SET role = 'dsm' 
WHERE id IN ('user-id-3', 'user-id-4');
```

### 3. Set Risk Indicator Values

Update existing accounts with the new risk indicator fields:

```sql
-- Example: Set auto_renew for accounts that have it
UPDATE accounts SET auto_renew = true 
WHERE /* your criteria */;

-- Example: Flag pricing outliers
UPDATE accounts SET pricing_outlier = true 
WHERE /* your criteria */;

-- Example: Set DSM risk assessments
UPDATE accounts SET dsm_risk_assessment = true 
WHERE /* your criteria */;
```

### 4. Test the Implementation

#### Test DSM Access:
1. Log in as a DSM user
2. Verify you only see "My Accounts" navigation
3. Verify you only see your assigned accounts
4. Try accessing `/dashboard/executive-summary` â†’ should redirect
5. Try accessing `/dashboard/accounts` â†’ should redirect

#### Test Exec Sponsor Access:
1. Log in as an Exec Sponsor user
2. Verify you see "Executive Summary" and "Account Search" navigation
3. Access Account Search and verify all accounts are visible
4. Test all filter options
5. Test export functionality
6. Verify risk indicator columns display correctly

#### Test Admin Access:
1. Log in as an Admin user
2. Verify you see all navigation items
3. Test all functionality

## Benefits
