## Health Score Calculation

### Overview

Health scores range from **0 to 1000** and determine account status.

### Status Thresholds

| Status | Health Score | Color | Meaning |
|--------|--------------|-------|---------|
| üü¢ **Green** (Healthy) | **‚â• 700** | Green | Account is in good standing, will renew |
| üü° **Yellow** (At Risk) | **500-699** | Yellow | Account needs attention, some risk |
| üî¥ **Red** (Critical) | **< 500** | Red | High churn risk, urgent action needed |

### Automatic Calculation Formula

Health Score is calculated using **weighted metrics** (industry best practices):

```typescript
Health Score = Œ£ (Metric Score √ó Weight)
```

#### **1. Product Adoption & Usage (40% = 400 points)**

**Solutions Adopted:**
- 1 solution: 100 points
- 2-3 solutions: 250 points
- 4+ solutions: 400 points

Based on: `current_solutions` field (comma-separated list)

**Platform Fee Growth:**
- Negative growth: 0 points
- 0-10% growth: 200 points
- >10% growth: 400 points

Based on: `platform_fee_usd` YoY comparison

#### **2. Engagement & Activity (30% = 300 points)**

**QBR Recency** (100 points max):
- < 30 days ago: 100 points
- 30-60 days ago: 75 points
- 60-90 days ago: 50 points
- > 90 days ago: 0 points

Based on: `last_qbr_date`

**Win Room Participation** (100 points max):
- 3+ win rooms (last 6 months): 100 points
- 1-2 win rooms: 50 points
- 0 win rooms: 0 points

Based on: `win_rooms` table count

**Activity Completion Rate** (100 points max):
- > 80% completed: 100 points
- 50-80% completed: 50 points
- < 50% completed: 0 points

Based on: `activities` table, `status = 'Completed'` ratio

#### **3. Financial & Contract Health (20% = 200 points)**

**Contract Renewal Proximity** (100 points max):
- > 180 days until expiry: 100 points
- 90-180 days: 75 points
- 30-90 days: 50 points
- < 30 days: 25 points

Based on: `subscription_end` date

**ARR Stability** (100 points max):
- ARR ‚â• $1M: 100 points
- ARR ‚â• $500K: 50 points
- ARR < $500K: 0 points

Based on: `arr_usd` field

#### **4. Risk & Relationship Indicators (10% = 100 points)**

**Active Risks** (penalty system):
- 0 risks: 100 points
- 1-2 risks: 50 points
- 3+ risks: 0 points
- **√ó0.5 if any "Relationship" risk exists**

Based on: `risks` table count and `risk_type`

**Stakeholder Sentiment** (50 points max):
- All green stakeholders: 50 points
- Mixed (some yellow): 25 points
- Any red stakeholders: 0 points

Based on: `stakeholders` table, `status` field

**Path to Green Bonus** (50 points):
- Has clear path to green: +50 points
- No path: 0 points

Based on: `path_to_green` boolean field

### Manual Override

Admins/DSMs can manually adjust health scores if they have business context the algorithm doesn't capture.

**Fields for Override:**
- `health_score_manual_override` (BOOLEAN)
- `health_score_override_reason` (TEXT)
- `health_score_last_calculated` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

### Implementation

```typescript
function calculateHealthScore(account, activities, risks, stakeholders, winRooms) {
  let score = 0
  
  // 1. Product Adoption (400 points)
  const solutionsCount = (account.current_solutions?.split(',').length || 0)
  score += Math.min(solutionsCount * 100, 400)
  
  // 2. Engagement (300 points)
  const daysSinceQBR = getDaysSince(account.last_qbr_date)
  score += daysSinceQBR < 30 ? 100 : daysSinceQBR < 60 ? 75 : daysSinceQBR < 90 ? 50 : 0
  
  const recentWinRooms = winRooms.filter(wr => isWithinLast6Months(wr.date)).length
  score += recentWinRooms >= 3 ? 100 : recentWinRooms >= 1 ? 50 : 0
  
  const completionRate = calculateCompletionRate(activities)
  score += completionRate > 0.8 ? 100 : completionRate > 0.5 ? 50 : 0
  
  // 3. Financial Health (200 points)
  const daysToRenewal = getDaysUntil(account.subscription_end)
  score += daysToRenewal > 180 ? 100 : daysToRenewal > 90 ? 75 : daysToRenewal > 30 ? 50 : 25
  score += account.arr_usd >= 1000 ? 100 : account.arr_usd >= 500 ? 50 : 0
  
  // 4. Risk Indicators (100 points)
  const riskPenalty = Math.min(risks.length * 25, 100)
  const hasRelationshipRisk = risks.some(r => r.risk_type === 'Relationship')
  score += 100 - (hasRelationshipRisk ? riskPenalty * 1.5 : riskPenalty)
  
  const greenStakeholders = stakeholders.filter(s => s.status === 'green').length
  score += stakeholders.length > 0 ? (greenStakeholders / stakeholders.length) * 50 : 0
  
  if (account.path_to_green) score += 50
  
  return Math.min(Math.max(Math.round(score), 0), 1000)
}
```

## KPI Calculations

All KPIs are calculated in real-time from the database via `/api/kpis`.

### 1. Total ARR at Risk

```sql
SELECT SUM(arr_usd) * 1000 
FROM accounts 
WHERE status IN ('yellow', 'red')
```

**Returns**: Dollar amount of at-risk ARR

### 2. Accounts at Risk

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM accounts 
WHERE status IN ('yellow', 'red')
```

**Returns**: Count of yellow and red accounts

### 3. WoW Change

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM accounts 
WHERE status IN ('yellow', 'red')
  AND updated_at >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days')
```

**Calculation**: 
```typescript
wowChangePercent = (recentlyAtRisk / totalAtRisk) * 100
```

**Returns**: Percentage of accounts that became at-risk this week

### 4. Accounts Through Win Room

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT account_id) 
FROM win_rooms 
WHERE date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days')
```

**Returns**: Unique count of accounts that had win rooms in last 30 days

### 5. Outstanding Follow-Ups

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM activities 
WHERE status != 'Completed'
```

**Returns**: Count of open activities (Not Started + In Progress)

### Top-50 Risk List

```typescript
const top50AtRisk = accounts
  .filter(acc => acc.status === 'yellow' || acc.status === 'red')
  .sort((a, b) => a.health_score - b.health_score)  // Lowest first
  .slice(0, 50)
```

Identifies the 50 accounts with lowest health scores that are at risk.

## Win Room Snapshots

### Purpose

Win Rooms capture a **complete point-in-time snapshot** of the account state, creating an immutable historical record.

### What's Captured

When a win room is created, the system snapshots:

1. **Complete Account Object** (`account_snapshot` JSONB)
   - All 18 account fields
   - DSM information
   - Exec Sponsor information
   - Health score
   - Status
   - ARR
   - All dates and metrics

2. **All Stakeholders** (`stakeholders_snapshot` JSONB)
   - Names, roles, descriptions
   - Status indicators

3. **All Risks** (`risks_snapshot` JSONB)
   - Risk types, key risks
   - Summaries, evidence, levers

4. **All Activities** (`activities_snapshot` JSONB)
   - Activities with descriptions
   - Owners and statuses
   - Due dates

5. **Outcome Notes** (`outcome_notes` TEXT)
   - Meeting outcomes
   - Decisions made
   - Next steps

### Historical View

**Click any past win room** ‚Üí Opens **Historical Account View Modal**

Shows the **entire account detail page** as it was at that moment:
- All account fields (read-only, gray background)
- All stakeholders that existed
- All risks that were documented
- All activities that were in progress
- Win room outcomes

**Benefits:**
- Compare account evolution over time
- Reference past states for decision making
- Audit trail of account changes
- Immutable records for compliance

### Database Schema

```sql
ALTER TABLE win_rooms ADD COLUMN account_snapshot JSONB;
ALTER TABLE win_rooms ADD COLUMN stakeholders_snapshot JSONB;
ALTER TABLE win_rooms ADD COLUMN risks_snapshot JSONB;
ALTER TABLE win_rooms ADD COLUMN activities_snapshot JSONB;
ALTER TABLE win_rooms ADD COLUMN is_historical BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

## Historical Data Tracking

### Health Score Snapshots Table

Stores daily/weekly snapshots for trending:

```sql
CREATE TABLE health_score_snapshots (
  account_id UUID,
  health_score INTEGER,
  status account_status,
  arr_usd NUMERIC,
  snapshot_date DATE,
  UNIQUE(account_id, snapshot_date)
);
```

**Purpose:**
- Powers ARR Trend Chart
- Tracks health score changes over time
- Enables historical analysis

**Capture:**
- Automatic (daily via scheduled job)
- Manual via: `POST /api/snapshots/capture`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Capture today's snapshot
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/snapshots/capture

# Generate historical data (6 months)
npx tsx scripts/generate-historical-snapshots.ts
```

---

## Charts Data Sources

All charts use **100% real database data**:

### 1. Accounts at Risk by Exec Sponsor

```typescript
accounts
  .filter(account => has exec_sponsor)
  .groupBy(exec_sponsor.name)
  .count(status === 'green' vs. status !== 'green')
```

**Real-time calculation** from current accounts

### 2. Total ARR at Risk Trend

```typescript
health_score_snapshots
  .filter(status === 'yellow' OR status === 'red')
  .groupBy(month)
  .sum(arr_usd)
```

**Historical data** from snapshots table (last 6 months)

### 3. Accounts by Contract Expiry Date

```typescript
accounts
  .filter(subscription_end > today)
  .groupBy(month_year of subscription_end)
  .count()
```

**Real-time calculation** from subscription dates

---

## Security & Data Integrity

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**All tables have RLS enabled:**
- Authenticated users can read all data
- DSMs can edit their own accounts' data
- Admins have full access
- Policies prevent unauthorized modifications

### Audit Trail

**Tracked Automatically:**
- `created_at` - When record was created
- `updated_at` - Last modification time
- Win room snapshots preserve historical states
- Health score history tracks changes

### API Authorization

**Every admin-only endpoint checks:**
1. User is authenticated (`auth.uid()`)
2. User's role from database
3. Returns 403 if not admin

**Protected Endpoints:**
- `/api/users` (POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- `/api/exec-sponsors` (POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- `/api/import/*` (all methods)

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Infinite recursion in policy"**
- Run `scripts/fix-rls-clean.sql` in Supabase
- Ensures policies don't self-reference

**2. "Account detail modal won't open"**
- Check that account has `dsm` and `exec_sponsor` joined
- Verify RLS policies allow reading related tables

**3. "Import fails with errors"**
- Check required fields (account name)
- Verify data types match (numbers as numbers, dates as YYYY-MM-DD)
- Review error messages in results

**4. "Charts show no data"**
- Run snapshot generation: `npx tsx scripts/generate-historical-snapshots.ts`
- Verify accounts have `exec_sponsor` and `subscription_end` populated

### Getting Help

For issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check terminal for API errors
3. Review `supabase/schema.sql` for database structure
4. Verify user has appropriate role permissions
