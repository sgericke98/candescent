# Authentication Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Magic Link Redirect Loop ✅
**Problem:** After clicking magic link in email, users were redirected back to login page instead of dashboard.

**Root Cause:** When users authenticated via magic link (or OAuth), they were successfully authenticated in Supabase Auth, but had no corresponding record in the `users` table. The dashboard layout then failed to find the user and redirected back to login.

**Solution:**
- Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to automatically create user records in the `users` table
- Updated `app/auth/login/page.tsx` to create user records on password login
- Updated `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` with a fallback to create user records if missing
- Auto-detects admin emails (daniel.ban@techtorch.io and santiago.gericke@techtorch.io) and grants admin role

### 2. Admin Email Access ✅
**Problem:** Need to grant admin access to specific TechTorch emails.

**Solution:**
Both emails now automatically receive admin role when they log in (via any method):
- daniel.ban@techtorch.io
- santiago.gericke@techtorch.io

### 3. Test Users Created ✅
**Problem:** Need test users with different roles for testing.

**Solution:**
Created `scripts/setup-test-users.ts` that creates three test users:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@candescent.test | Admin123!@# |
| Exec Sponsor | exec@candescent.test | Exec123!@# |
| DSM | dsm@candescent.test | DSM123!@# |

2. Then log in with test credentials:
   - **Test as Admin:** admin@candescent.test / Admin123!@#
   - **Test as Exec Sponsor:** exec@candescent.test / Exec123!@#
   - **Test as DSM:** dsm@candescent.test / DSM123!@#

## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Magic Link Flow (Fixed):
1. User requests magic link → Email sent
2. User clicks link → Redirects to `/auth/callback?code=xxx`
3. **NEW:** Callback exchanges code for session
4. **NEW:** Checks if user exists in `users` table
5. **NEW:** If not, creates user record with appropriate role
6. **NEW:** Admin emails automatically get admin role
7. Redirects to `/dashboard`
8. Dashboard finds user record ✅
9. Shows appropriate navigation based on role ✅

### Password Login Flow (Fixed):
1. User enters email/password → Authenticates
2. **NEW:** Checks if user exists in `users` table
3. **NEW:** If not, creates user record
4. Redirects to `/dashboard` ✅

### Fallback Safety Net:
Even if something goes wrong, the dashboard layout will now:
1. Check for user record
2. If missing, create it
3. Redirect to refresh the page
4. User sees dashboard ✅

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **No More Manual User Creation:** Users are automatically created on first login
2. **Admin Email Auto-Detection:** TechTorch emails automatically get admin access
3. **Multiple Auth Methods:** Works with magic link, password, and OAuth
4. **Graceful Error Handling:** Multiple fallback layers to prevent redirect loops
5. **Test Users Ready:** Easy testing with pre-configured accounts

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Create Test Users:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:test-users
   ```

3. **Test Magic Link:**
   - Use your @techtorch.io email
   - Verify you get admin access
   - Verify no redirect loop

4. **Test Different Roles:**
   - Log in as each test user
   - Verify role-based navigation
   - Verify data access restrictions

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Still seeing redirect loop?
1. Clear browser cookies/cache
2. Make sure you ran the database migration
3. Check the browser console for errors
4. Try incognito mode

### User record not being created?
1. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
2. Verify RLS policies allow inserts to `users` table
3. Check that NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is correct

### Magic link not arriving?
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify email settings in Supabase dashboard
3. Check Supabase logs for email sending errors

**All fixed!** 🎉 Your authentication should now work smoothly with automatic user creation and admin access for your TechTorch emails.
