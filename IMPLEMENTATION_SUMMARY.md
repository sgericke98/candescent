# Detail Account View - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Detail Account View feature that displays all account information with related data (stakeholders, risks, activities, win rooms) in a modal dialog accessible from all dashboard views.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Type Definitions (`/lib/types/database.ts`)
Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all database entities:
- **Base Types**: User, ExecSponsor, Account
- **Related Types**: Stakeholder, Risk, Activity, WinRoom
- **Extended Type**: AccountWithDetails (includes all related data)
- **Enums**: UserRole, AccountStatus, ActivityStatus, RiskType

### 2. Backend API (`/app/api/accounts/[id]/route.ts`)
New API endpoint for fetching single account with all relations:
- **Endpoint**: GET `/api/accounts/:id`
- **Features**:
  - Single query joins: account + dsm + exec_sponsor + stakeholders + risks + activities + win_rooms
  - Automatic sorting (activities by due date, win rooms by date)
  - Proper error handling (404 for not found, 500 for server errors)
  - Full type safety with TypeScript

### 3. Account Detail Modal Component (`/components/account-detail-modal.tsx`)
Completely redesigned modal matching the visual requirements:

## Database Schema Alignment

All fields from the Supabase schema are properly mapped:

### Pre-populated (Blue) Fields ✅
- Account name, location, type, RSSID, DI number
- DSM, Exec Sponsor
- AUM, ARR, Platform fee
- Health score, Status, Path to green
- Subscription end, Last QBR, Last touchpoint
- Current solutions
- Open activities count

### Manually Editable (Purple) Fields - Ready for Implementation
- Win room information (date, notes)
- Battle plan details
- Risks (type, summary, evidence, levers)
- Stakeholders (name, role, description, status)
- Activities (activity, owner, description, status, due date)

## Edit Functionality Foundation

Infrastructure in place for edit functionality:
- `canEdit` prop on AccountDetailModal
- Edit button with toggle state
- `isEditing` state management
- Authorization checks can be added based on user role

**Next Steps for Full Edit Implementation:**
1. Create PUT/PATCH API endpoint for updates
2. Add form inputs for editable fields
3. Implement validation logic
4. Add save/cancel handlers
5. Show success/error notifications
6. Refresh data after save

## Technical Highlights

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Performance**: Single database query with joins
- **Scalability**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Maintainability**: Reusable components and utilities
- **Best Practices**: Proper error handling, loading states, accessibility

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/lib/types/database.ts` - Type definitions
- `/app/api/accounts/[id]/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `/components/account-detail-modal.tsx` - Complete redesign
- `/components/dashboard/executive-summary.tsx` - Modal integration
- `/components/dashboard/dsm-view.tsx` - Modal integration
