# Executive Dashboard Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the executive dashboard to comprehensively answer key strategic questions about portfolio risk management and intervention effectiveness.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Risk Evolution - Waterfall Charts
**Location:** `/components/charts/risk-waterfall-chart.tsx`

**Purpose:** Visualize how risk in the portfolio changes over time with detailed breakdowns.

**Features:**
- **Week over Week (WoW) Analysis**
  - Starting at-risk accounts (baseline)
  - Term notices (accounts churning/leaving)
  - Renewals (accounts successfully renewed)
  - Risk de-escalations (yellow/red ‚Üí green)
  - Risk escalations (green ‚Üí yellow/red)
  - Ending at-risk accounts (current state)

- **Year to Date (YTD) Analysis**
  - Same metrics as WoW but year-to-date comparison
  
- **Dual View Modes:**
  - ACV View: Shows monetary impact
  - Logo Count View: Shows account volume impact

- **Interactive Charts:**
  - Bar chart with color-coded categories
  - Tooltips showing both logos and ACV
  - Summary statistics table

**API Endpoint:** `/api/analytics/waterfall`

## New API Endpoints

    },
    // ... other categories
  ]
}
```

**Functionality:**

```json
{
  "winRooms": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "account_id": "uuid",
      "date": "2025-01-15",
      "outcome_notes": "...",
      "account": {

        "name": "Example Bank",
        "arr_usd": 150,
        "status": "yellow",
        "health_score": 450,
        "dsm": { ... }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Functionality:**
- Fetches all win room records with account details
- Used for calculating cycle counts and effectiveness metrics

## Questions Answered

### ‚úÖ How has risk in the portfolio evolved over time?
- **Waterfall Charts** show WoW and YTD changes with specific categories:
  - Term notices (logo count + ACV)
  - Renewals (logo count + ACV)
  - Risk escalations (logo count + ACV)
  - Risk de-escalations (logo count + ACV)

### ‚úÖ What is the composition of risk in the portfolio today?
- **Risk Composition Charts** provide firmographics by:
  - Size (ARR bands)
  - Account type
  - DSM assignment
  - Exec Sponsor assignment
  - Additional dimensions can be easily added (core, CED, etc.)

### ‚úÖ What is the adherence to and status of our risk interventions?
- **Activity Status Dashboard** shows:
  - Activities by status: Complete, Past Due, Roadblocked, On Track
  - Completion rates and attention metrics
  
- **Win Room Effectiveness Tracker** shows:
  - At-risk accounts through win room vs. not (logo count + ACV)

  - Accounts on deck for upcoming win rooms

---

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations:
- All data is fetched on component mount
- Charts use Recharts library for consistent styling
- Snapshots table is indexed for efficient querying
- API endpoints use Supabase RLS for security

### Styling:
- Components follow existing design system
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent color scheme:
  - Green: Positive metrics (renewals, de-escalations, completed)
  - Red: Negative metrics (term notices, escalations, past due)
  - Blue: Neutral/informational metrics
  - Yellow/Orange: Warning metrics

### Error Handling:
- All API calls have try-catch blocks
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Loading states for all async operations
- Console logging for debugging
